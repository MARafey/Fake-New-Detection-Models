Trump\\u2019s visit to a black church here on Saturday will be a major moment for a candidate with a history of offending the sensibilities of black Americans. His team was leaving nothing to chance. Instead of speaking to the congregation at Great Faith Ministries International, Mr. Trump had planned to be interviewed by its pastor in a session that would be closed to the public and the news media, with questions submitted in advance. And instead of letting Mr. Trump be his freewheeling self, his campaign prepared lengthy answers for the submitted questions, consulting black Republicans to make sure he says the right things. An   draft script obtained by The New York Times shows 12 questions that Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, the pastor, intends to ask Mr. Trump in the taped    session, as well as the responses Mr. Trump is being advised to give. The proposed answers were devised by aides working for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, according to an official who has been involved in the planning but declined to be identified while speaking about confidential strategy. The document includes the exact wording of answers the aides are proposing for Mr. Trump to give to questions about police killings, racial tension and the perception among many black voters that he and the Republican Party are racist, among other topics. The official said the answers could change based on feedback from the black Republicans they are consulting with. After this article was published online Thursday night, Jason Miller, the senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, said that Mr. Trump\\u2019s plans had changed and that he would address the congregation for five to 10 minutes after the interview. Mr. Trump will then visit neighborhoods with Ben Carson, a onetime campaign rival, who supports Mr. Trump and grew up in Detroit. \\u201cIf you know anything about Mr. Trump, it\\u2019s that he will want the opportunity to take his vision and message of opportunity directly to the people on Saturday,\\u201d Mr. Miller said. It is not uncommon for a candidate to request interview questions in advance aides to Hillary Clinton do it from time to time. But it is unusual for a campaign to go so far as to prepare a script for a candidate\\u2019s own responses, and highlights the sensitivity of Mr. Trump\\u2019s first appearance at a black church. A series of slights, including his questioning of President Obama\\u2019s birth certificate, has not endeared him to black voters. The interview will air about a week later on the Impact Network, Bishop Jackson\\u2019s Christian cable TV channel. The official said several Trump aides would work with the network to edit the taped interview so that the final version reflected the campaign\\u2019s wishes. (On Thursday night, Mr. Miller said the campaign would not edit the interview.) The arrangements had angered several black Republicans, who urged Mr. Trump, widely seen as distant from the black community, to speak for at least 10 minutes at the service, the official involved in the planning said. The official added that the campaign had been uncomfortable with Mr. Trump\\u2019s speaking before the congregation and had insisted on a private interview. On Thursday night, the campaign said Mr. Trump would indeed address the congregation for a few minutes and would spend a   casually speaking with church members individually. Mr. Trump is well known for veering from prepared remarks or throwing them away entirely. That could happen on Saturday: Many of the answers being prepared for him do not sound much like Mr. Trump as his usual self. When asked about his vision for black Americans, the script suggests that Mr. Trump stay positive, advising that he use lines such as \\u201cIf we are to make America great again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country\\u201d and \\u201cI want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance. \\u201d To a question submitted by Bishop Jackson about whether his campaign is racist, the script suggests that Mr. Trump avoid repeating the word, and instead speak about improving education and getting people off welfare and back to work. \\u201cThe proof, as they say, will be in the pudding,\\u201d Mr. Trump is advised to say. \\u201cComing into a community is meaningless unless we offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America. \\u201d To the first question, \\u201cAre you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God?\\u201d the scriptwriters have a response they hope will keep Mr. Trump from repeating previous stumbles when asked about his faith. \\u201cAs I went through my life, things got busy with business, but my family kept me grounded to the truth and the word of God,\\u201d the script has Mr. Trump saying. \\u201cI treasure my relationship with my family, and through them, I have a strong faith enriched by an   God. \\u201d Bishop Jackson said Thursday that he saw no problem with the campaign\\u2019s asking to screen his questions, and noted that in the past he had given advance text of prayers he planned to deliver at the White House. \\u201cWe want this to be as peaceful as possible,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I promised would happen. I promised that: You are coming into a place to be interviewed and we don\\u2019t want anybody to be hurt or anybody to be misused, so that\\u2019s it. \\u201d Of all the proposed answers, the most   might be his reply to the final question of the interview: What he would say to undecided black voters? \\u201cIf you want a strong partner in this journey, you will vote for me. I will never let you down,\\u201d Mr. Trump is directed to say, adding, \\u201cBy the way, my support is now up to 8 percent and climbing. \\u201d\",\n          \"DAVOS, Switzerland  \\u2014   In a world troubled by grave uncertainties over the basics governing trade, security and the mission to limit climate change, President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday portrayed his nation as a responsible global citizen dedicated to furthering international integration. That a leader of the People\\u2019s Republic of China can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen, even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months. His message, delivered here in the Swiss Alps at the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum, appeared meticulously timed to the tumultuous moment at hand. He was speaking three days before Donald J. Trump was to be inaugurated president of the United States, raising the prospect of a trade war with China, and on the same day that Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain outlined plans to pursue her country\\u2019s departure from the European Union. The Chinese leader used his moment to make an expansive case for globalization as a source of prosperity. He never mentioned Mr. Trump by name, nor did he even make reference to the fact that the White House is about to gain a new occupant. Yet his speech resonated as a rebuke of the trajectory that the   has promised  \\u2014   not least, his repeated threat of steep tariffs on Chinese goods as a response to what he portrays as predatory trade practices. In myriad ways, Mr. Xi is a strikingly   steward of openness and connectivity. Under his direction, China\\u2019s Communist Party has clamped down severely on civil society, tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country\\u2019s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people. He has projected China\\u2019s navy into contested waters in the South China and East China Seas. Throughout his speech, Mr. Xi carefully used the phrase \\u201ceconomic globalization,\\u201d while avoiding unqualified \\u201cglobalization,\\u201d reflecting China\\u2019s spurning of an open internet, universal human rights and free elections. Indeed, the metaphor he used to reject protectionism  \\u2014   \\u201clike locking oneself in a dark room\\u201d  \\u2014   could just as well have been used to describe China\\u2019s political path under his leadership, with the Communist Party overtly guiding a campaign to restrict the influence of what it labels Western notions such as democracy. This month, China\\u2019s top judge delivered a speech sharply criticizing the idea of an independent judiciary, which he said must be \\u201cresolutely rejected. \\u201d Not for nothing, China carries a reputation as a country willing to bend the norms of global commerce when such a course suits its interests. Steel producers around the globe complain that Beijing dumps its  steel on world markets at prices lower than the cost of raw materials, costing jobs at mills from Italy to Indiana. But the populist ferment refashioning the global order has made previously unthinkable roles possible. In the United States, the supposed citadel of free market enterprise, a wealthy real estate magnate has captured the White House on the strength of his appeal as a supposed champion of   workers. Here in Davos, where technology executives fret about the plight of   Africa while drinking champagne paid for by investment banks, the chairman of the Communist Party of China  \\u2014   an institution that rules in the name of   revolution  \\u2014   draped himself in the banner of globalization. None of these details were featured in Mr. Xi\\u2019s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite. For Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, the participation of China\\u2019s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a Chinese head of state had attended. Mr. Schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment. He asked no questions, solicited none from the audience, and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience. \\u201cIn a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability,\\u201d Mr. Schwab said. That Mr. Xi chose this year to make his debut underscores China\\u2019s attempt to improve its international standing just as much of the world appears in turmoil. The United States is about to inaugurate as president someone who has questioned the relevance of powerful institutions that have anchored the world order for decades, from NATO to the World Trade Organization. Britain is pursuing a fraught divorce from the European Union, dealing a blow to those who have advanced regional integration as a solution to economic and security problems. The growing electoral strength of populist,   Union parties in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany has intensified fears that the union may not endure. These developments have yielded a gnawing sense that a complex world is suddenly short of adult supervision. Mr. Xi devoted his speech to trying to fill that vacuum, casting China as a trustworthy power in which   people are taking considered action to address consequential challenges  \\u2014   from climate change to a weak global economy. \\u201cThis appears to be a time of uncertainty in the United States, in the U. K.,\\u201d said   Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing who invests in emerging Chinese companies. \\u201cThe world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence. \\u201d In keeping with the traditions of speeches delivered by senior Chinese officials, Mr. Xi\\u2019s address was long on platitudes, tortured metaphors and literary references, while nearly bereft of policy pronouncements. Yet, in totality, it delivered a striking message: In an era in which the United States and Britain are consumed with recriminations over the strains of globalization, China will continue to tether its fortunes to world trade. Mr. Trump has picked as a key trade adviser the economist Peter Navarro, who has long portrayed China as a mortal threat to American prosperity. Mr. Trump has threatened to brand the country a currency manipulator, opening the door to punitive tariffs. Though Beijing has in years past maintained its currency, the renminbi, at artificially low levels to make its goods cheap on world markets, it has in recent months intervened aggressively in the other direction, propping up its value against the dollar. \\u201cChina has no intention to boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing the RMB,\\u201d Mr. Xi said. In another implicit rebuke of Mr. Trump, the Chinese president argued forcefully for   on the 2015 Paris climate accord. Mr. Trump has threatened to renounce the deal while naming to his cabinet several people who question the basic scientific consensus on climate change. \\u201cThe Paris agreement was hard won,\\u201c Mr. Xi said. \\u201cAll signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations. \\u201d Mr. Xi was accompanied by an enormous delegation of Chinese officials and business executives who reveled in a moment on the world stage, posing for photos as they awaited the president\\u2019s arrival. In conversations on the sidelines, many expressed concerns about the threats of tariffs from the incoming Trump administration, fearing the consequences of a potential trade war between the world\\u2019s two largest economies. But most assumed tough rhetoric would eventually give way to the realities of shared commercial interests. China relies on access to the United States, the largest consumer market on earth, as the landing place for its exports. The United States depends upon China for a vast range of finished goods. Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, the Chinese   giant, said he assumed cooler heads would find a way to avoid trade hostilities. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it will happen,\\u201d he said of the hostilities. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be a disaster if it does. \\u201d More than a decade has passed since the United States Congress effectively prevented CNOOC, a Chinese   oil company, from buying the American energy company Unocal, branding the merger a threat to national security. Fu Chengyu, CNOOC\\u2019s chief executive at that time, pointed to the treatment of the merger as an indication of American hypocrisy on free trade. But on Tuesday, as he waited for the Chinese president to deliver his address, Mr. Fu, who recently retired from another major Chinese energy company but retains a party post, expressed confidence that Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump would forge common ground. \\u201cEventually, they will cooperate to get more benefits,\\u201d Mr. Fu said. \\u201cAt the beginning, Trump will say something very harsh. He will try to do something punishing. But this is a   sword. Once he\\u2019s in the White House, he will see things differently. \\u201d\",\n          \"PARIS  \\u2014   Just after midnight on Monday, Kim Kardashian West left an intimate Fashion Week reception and dinner in the Marais section of Paris, at which truffled scrambled eggs, white fish and copious amounts of Champagne were served. With her sister Kourtney Kardashian, she posed for some paparazzi waiting outside. Along with a bodyguard, they entered a dark van with tinted windows and drove off. About two and a half hours later, French officials said, Ms. Kardashian West, a reality television star, was robbed at gunpoint of jewelry worth at least 8 million euros, or nearly $9 million. She was alone in a luxurious apartment in the Eighth Arrondissement, nearly two miles from the dinner, when two men burst in, tied her up and gagged her, then escaped with at least three accomplices, officials said. The crime stunned fans of Ms. Kardashian West, who has millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram. Her husband, the musician Kanye West, abruptly walked off the stage of a concert in Queens when he learned of the crime. It also focused unwanted attention on France, where tourism has plummeted following a series of major terrorist attacks. Crucial details remained unclear on Monday, including why Ms. Kardashian West was alone and why she was carrying such valuable jewelry. But police officials and the mayor of Paris vowed to get to the bottom of the crime and to reassure their citizens, and foreigners, that the French capital was safe to visit. \\u201cI condemn the attack Kim Kardashian suffered last night in her hotel,\\u201d the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said in a statement. \\u201cShe has my support and will always be welcome here in Paris. I have full confidence that the police force, as part of their investigation, will quickly identify and apprehend the perpetrators of these acts. \\u201d A spokesman for the investigative unit of the Paris police said the men were part of a group of about five people who stormed the V. I. P. residence, the H\\u00f4tel de Pourtal\\u00e8s, near the Madeleine church. At least one had a handgun. Luc Poignant, a spokesman for a police officers\\u2019 union, said the men locked Ms. Kardashian West in a bathroom after tying her up with tape. Along with the jewelry, which included a ring, they made off with cellphones and a wallet that contained credit cards. Three of the men left on foot, and two on bikes, he said. The men had targeted their victim  \\u2014   they forced the concierge to tell them where Ms. Kardashian West was staying, and tied his hands. The men appeared to have worn shirts identifying themselves as police officers  \\u2014   but also balaclavas and gloves, which are not part of the police uniform. Ms. Kardashian West was \\u201cbadly shaken but physically unharmed,\\u201d her spokeswoman told The Associated Press, offering no further details. It appeared that Ms. Kardashian West gave a statement to the police before she departed, but her representatives did not respond to multiple messages requesting details. Foreign tourism to France has dropped substantially after major terrorism attacks in Paris in November 2015 and in the Mediterranean city of Nice in July. France remains under a state of emergency. \\u201cThis is a very rare occurrence that took place in a private space, and in no way does it call into question the work of our police or the security of our public spaces,\\u201d Ms. Hidalgo, the mayor, said on Monday. \\u201cIt is possible to visit the French capital and enjoy all it has to offer in secure conditions. \\u201d Nonetheless, the attack on Ms. Kardashian West quickly became political fodder on Monday. Presidential elections are scheduled for next year, and the incumbent, Fran\\u00e7ois Hollande of the Socialist Party, is expected to face a stiff challenge from   candidates who are competing with Mr. Hollande to appear tough on crime. \\u201cWhat happened to her is running nonstop on every channel,\\u201d Nathalie   a member of the National Assembly with the   opposition party, the Republicans, told the radio station Europe1. \\u201cDo you realize the kind of   this is for Paris? Today, you can make any kind of commercial you want for Paris, and they are very expensive. All these commercials were canceled out by what happened to Kim Kardashian. \\u201d On Twitter, Florian Philippot, the vice president of the   National Front party, denounced the \\u201cviolent aggression\\u201d against Ms. Kardashian West and warned, \\u201cOnce again, tourism is going to pay for this chronic insecurity in France. \\u201d He also accused Ms. Hidalgo of \\u201cblindness\\u201d and said she was in an \\u201civory tower. \\u201d Ms. Hidalgo, for her part, warned politicians not to exploit the issue for political gain.   crimes are not uncommon in France, which by many estimates remains the world\\u2019s   country. In 2013, a thief robbed a luxury hotel in Cannes, on the Riviera, and made off with tens of millions of dollars in jewelry. In 2014, the Place Vend\\u00f4me, one of the most fashionable squares in Paris, was hit by a series of    robberies. Last year, thieves  assaulted two armored vans and made off with jewelry worth an estimated $10 million. Only a few days ago, Ms. Kardashian West was tackled in a Paris street by a man who was pinned to the ground by her bodyguards. The man, identified as Vitalii Sediuk, had a record for following celebrities around and did not appear to be a robber. On Sunday evening, Ms. Kardashian West attended the Givenchy fashion show with her sister Kourtney and their mother, Kris Jenner, and the rock singer Courtney Love, before making her way to the dinner, which was hosted by the American design magazine Surface in honor of the designer Azzedine Ala\\u00efa. \\u201cI just can\\u2019t believe it,\\u201d said Pierre Hardy, who designs footwear and accessories for Herm\\u00e8s and attended the dinner. \\u201cThere she was with all of us, and then hours later that happens. It\\u2019s unbelievable. \\u201d Another guest at the dinner, Deena Aljuhani Abdulaziz, the new editor in chief of Vogue Arabia and a member of the Saudi royal family, said on Monday: \\u201cThere\\u2019s no question in my mind that this will play heavily on the mind of shoppers and travelers from the Gulf when it comes to visiting in Paris. Lots wear their jewelry very openly here. They shop. And have always felt very safe doing so. But when something like this can happen, and to someone with such a good security detail, well  \\u2014   it\\u2019s a big surprise. And it\\u2019s very frightening. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Most of these are centered around the notion of telling people what to do and how to live their lives, with the aim of convincing people that conformity to church guidelines will bring some intangible reward in the afterlife.\\n\\n\\nOne example of many is the Christian belief that the one and only way not to eternally burn in Hell is to accept Jesus Christ as the savior, as if no other deity or religious experience is valid to the human experience.\\n\\nThe concept of heaven and hell has been so ingrained into the human psyche that many people cannot see beyond this limiting paradigm to any other possibility. Retired Episcopal bishop John Shelby Spong , however, doesn\\u2019t seem to believe in the myth of Hell, and during a nationally televised interview he shared his opinions on why he thinks convincing the flock to believe in the concept of \\u2018Hell\\u2019 is absolutely critical to the Church\\u2019s survival.\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think Hell exists. I happen to believe in life after death, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s got a thing to do with reward and punishment. Religion is always in the control business, and that\\u2019s something people don\\u2019t really understand. It\\u2019s in a guilt-producing control business. And if you have Heaven as a place where you\\u2019re rewarded for your goodness, and Hell is a place where you\\u2019re punished for your evil, then you sort of have control of the population. And so they create this fiery place which has quite literally scared the Hell out of a lot of people, throughout Christian history. And it\\u2019s part of a control tactic.\\u201d  Many people turn to religious teachings for solace and guidance in life in our insane world, but, Bishop Spong seems to think religion helps people be less responsible for their own life and the world we live in, offering a unique perspective from the typical doctrines of Christian belief. \\u201cThe church doesn\\u2019t like for people to grow up, because you can\\u2019t control grown-ups. That\\u2019s why we talk about being born again. When you\\u2019re born again, you\\u2019re still a child. People don\\u2019t need to be born again. They need to grow up. They need to accept their responsibility for themselves and the world.\\u201d No one can really confirm where human souls are bound after death, so why do religions create stories of places like Heaven and Hell? The answer is simple: to control people and keep the Church alive.\\n\\nIf even some of the most religious men, such as Bishop John Shelby Spong, are starting to publicly expose the motivations behind these stories, perhaps it is time for the masses to critically evaluate the value of religion over the importance of direct personal spiritual experience .\\n\\u201cEvery church I know claims that \\u2018we are the true church\\u2019 \\u2013 that they have some ultimate authority, \\u2018We have the infallible Pope,\\u2019 \\u2018We have the Bible.\\u2019\\u2026 The idea that the truth of God can be bound in any human system, by any human creed, by any human book, is almost beyond imagination for me. \\nGod is not a Christian. God is not a Jew or a Muslim or a Hindi or Buddhist. All of those are human systems, which human beings have created to try to help us walk into the mystery of God. I honor my tradition. I walk through my tradition. But I don\\u2019t think my tradition defines God. It only points me to God.\\u201d WATCH THE  VIDEO: \\n\\n\\nWaking Times SOURCE \",\n          \"European Parliament suspends negotiations with Turkey on EU membership November 24, 2016 - Fort Russ News - RIA Novosti - translated by J. Arnoldski - At a plenary session in Strasbourg, the European Parliament approved a resolution calling on the EU to suspend negotiations on Turkey\\u2019s membership over the actions of the Turkish authorities. The head of European diplomacy, Federica Mogherini, said during a debate in the European Parliament session that relations between Ankara and the EU are at a crossroads and that \\u201cthe transition from rhetoric to action on the issue of the death penalty will be a signal that Turkey does not want to be a member of the European family, nor the Council of Europe, nor the European Union.\\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated on Wednesday that the adoption of the resolution means nothing to Turkey. Commenting on the results of the vote in the European Parliament, the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Celik, said that \\u201cwhile Turkey, due to threats from Syria and Iraq, is undergoing a difficult period in the fight against terrorism, unfortunately, short-sided and one-sided discussions are happening in Europe.\\u201d Brussels has repeatedly asserted that Ankara\\u2019s behavior calls into question its desire to join the bloc. In early November, in its yearly report on Turkey\\u2019s progress on the road to joining the EU, the European Commission highlighted Ankara\\u2019s failures in policy in the fields of civil society, human rights, and freedom of speech. The report also noted that Turkey\\u2019s authorities are not doing enough to bring legislation in line with European norms. The agreement on association between the European community and Turkey was signed in 1963. Ankara applied for membership in 1987. However, negotiations on joining the EU, which began only in 2005, have repeatedly been complicated by disagreements that have now led to their suspension. Now only 16 out of 35 chapters of the negotiation file on Turkey joining the EU are open. In March 2016, the leaders of EU member countries agreed to intensify negotiations in exchange for Ankara\\u2019s agreement to contribute to reducing the influx of migrants to Europe via Turkish territory.

Here are some of the most significant elements of the new approach: In 2014, the Obama administration issued guidelines for deporting unauthorized immigrants that placed the highest priority on gang members, felons and those who posed security threats. A goal was to concentrate limited resources on the most serious cases, but many Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents complained that the priorities tied their hands, taking away their discretion as to whom to pursue. Under the new directives, the government \\u201cno longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. \\u201d Immigration agents can now focus on picking up and removing anyone charged with or convicted of any criminal offense, even minor ones, as well as anyone already ordered deported, regardless of whether they have a criminal record. One unauthorized immigrant in California, Kristina, who did not want her last name used because of fear of deportation, said she was alarmed to learn on Tuesday that she would now be considered a prime target. Kristina has been in the country for 25 years and has been ordered deported, but her removal had been postponed for the last four years by the Obama administration. \\u201cWe have our whole lives here our children are citizens,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNow I don\\u2019t know if I can go out, if I should drive. \\u201d But the Obama guidelines \\u201ctranslated into de facto protections\\u201d for people with no legal right to live in the United States, said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants. Unless they fell into one of the   categories, Mr. Stein said, \\u201cthe chance of being deported was virtually zero. \\u201d Under the Obama administration, people caught crossing the border without permission were often released into the United States while their requests for asylum wound through the immigration system, a process that can take years. Most requests are denied, but by then, the immigrant has been living in the United States all that time and may not be easy to find. The Trump administration has declared an end to the   catch and release policy, though it may take awhile to see any significant change. \\u201cCatch and release\\u201d came about in part because the government had nowhere to hold detainees waiting for immigration decisions. One of the memos released on Tuesday directs officials to expand detention facilities, but it will take time to build centers big enough, or find enough room in jails, to hold the thousands of Mexican and Central American asylum seekers expected to cross the border this year. The document also raises another alternative: sending migrants back to Mexico to wait out the immigration process, even those who are not originally from Mexico. That proposal comes with its own problems. Though United States law appears to allow it, Mexico\\u2019s laws do not, if the immigrant is not a Mexican citizen. Two decades ago, Congress passed a law allowing the government to quickly deport undocumented immigrants who have not been in the United States very long, without allowing them go before a judge. In practice, the government has used this process, called \\u201cexpedited removal,\\u201d relatively narrowly because of concerns about whether it violates constitutional rights of due process that are granted to anyone in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Since 2002, expedited removal has been applied only to immigrants who have been in the country less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border. That is because the Supreme Court has held that such immigrants can still be considered \\u201cin transit\\u201d and not here long enough to qualify for due process protections. The Trump administration is now planning to use expedited removal as extensively as the original law allows, saying that limits on its use had contributed to a backlog of more than half a million cases in immigration court. Immigration advocates vowed to challenge the change. \\u201cSomeone could be living in Chicago for a year and a half and then be swept off the street by an ICE agent,\\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A. C. L. U.\\u2019s Immigrants\\u2019 Rights Project, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. \\u201cHe is going to be detained and removed right away without ever seeing a judge. \\u201d One of the memos on Tuesday acknowledges that children who arrive at the border alone  \\u2014   \\u201cunaccompanied alien children,\\u201d in government parlance  \\u2014   are entitled to special protections: Unlike other border crossers, whom border patrol agents may deport without a legal hearing, these children must appear before an immigration judge and be interviewed by an asylum officer. Children have surged across the border in recent years, many fleeing violence and destitution in Central America. But the memo turns a sterner face to their parents, who, under the new policy, may be subject to deportation or even prosecution for enabling their children to come into the country. The memo notes that parents and relatives often pay smugglers several thousand dollars to bring their children from Central America, an act that the memo says amounts to facilitating illegal smuggling or trafficking. Immigration advocates are predicting that the policy will drive parents of migrant children further underground. With parents fearful of prosecution, advocates say, navigating the immigration process  \\u2014   or even showing up to court  \\u2014   could become much harder for these children. Some 750, 000 people who were brought into the country as children were issued work permits and temporary protection from deportation under an Obama program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Even President Trump said last week that the subject \\u201cis very, very difficult\\u201d for him and that he promised to \\u201cdeal with DACA with heart. \\u201d So far, the Trump administration has left the program alone. But chills went through the community of \\u201cDreamers,\\u201d as DACA recipients are known, with the recent arrest of a    Mexican immigrant in Washington State, Daniel Ramirez. Immigration agents arrested him when they went to his house to detain his father, a convicted drug trafficker. They said Mr. Ramirez admitted to having gang affiliations, which cancels the protection offered under DACA. But Mr. Ramirez denies having made the admission, and his lawyers are fighting his deportation. A program known as 287( g) named for its section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows the Department of Homeland Security to train local and state law enforcement officers to work as de facto federal immigration officers, identifying undocumented immigrants in their communities and jails and turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. From 2006 to 2013, the program led to 175, 000 deportations, according to federal statistics. But investigations and court rulings revealed an ugly side effect: In some jurisdictions, local officers were using their authority to racially profile Latinos. One of the most egregious cases was in Maricopa County, Arizona\\u2019s most populous, during the tenure of Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, who a federal judge ruled had discriminated against Latinos in patrols and other enforcement efforts. The Obama administration curtailed the use of the program, which currently involves 32 agencies in 16 states. The Trump administration wants more agencies to take part, and some have already expressed a desire to do so. The administration is trying to significantly expand the amount of information available on the enforcement of immigration laws and, in particular, unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will establish a new office to work with the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom appeared with Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. The office, known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice, will provide victims with information about defendants\\u2019 immigration status and whether they are in jail. Significantly, funding for the office comes from reallocating \\u201cany and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens\\u201d by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE will now have to provide monthly public reports on its apprehensions and releases. The agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails. That is a clear shot across the bow at   sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, contending that turning in unauthorized immigrants would destroy the fragile relationship that the police have with immigrant communities. \\u201cWe are going to continue our policy that has been in place because we think that it helps us have a safer, stronger, better community,\\u201d Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse said on Tuesday. The Trump administration is already pondering ways to punish those cities by denying them some federal aid. \\u201cNow everyone is going to be able to see how many criminal aliens are being released as a result of the sanctuary policies,\\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration. In January 2009, the departing Bush administration extended some Privacy Act rights, which American citizens and legal permanent residents already had, to undocumented immigrants. That meant that information obtained by one agency, like the Internal Revenue Service or Citizenship and Immigration Services, could not generally be shared with other agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One rationale for the move was to protect the personal information of immigrants who might one day become citizens covered by the Privacy Act. The Trump administration has now rescinded those privacy protections. One of the memos released on Tuesday said that those protections had been detrimental to the families of the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, because those families could not get information about such defendants\\u2019 legal status, or whether they had been deported, leaving victims \\u201cfeeling marginalized and without a voice. \\u201d The Department of Homeland Security said it would develop new rules on the sharing of undocumented immigrants\\u2019 private information. But advocates for unauthorized immigrants said they feared that immigrants who had applied for legal status  \\u2014   in the process divulging they were not here legally  \\u2014   were now in danger of having that information used to deport them. \\u201cThe constitution doesn\\u2019t traditionally allow bait and switches,\\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an organization that advocates for immigrants. \\u201cThese are folks who submitted their information attempting to play by the rules, with part of the rules being that the government would protect their privacy. \\u201d The memos released on Tuesday repeat Mr. Trump\\u2019s demand in his executive order for a larger enforcement force that can speed up the removal of millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States. In practice, that may play out more slowly than the president might prefer. The source of this caution is none other than John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, who told lawmakers this month that he did not believe it would be possible to hire the desired 15, 000 ICE and border patrol agents in the next couple of years. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather have fewer and make sure that they\\u2019re   people,\\u201d Mr. Kelly told lawmakers. \\u201cI will not skimp on the training and the standards. \\u201d On top of the stringent hiring standards and training, Border Patrol applicants are required to take a polygraph test, which nearly 60 percent fail. A previous surge in hiring under President George W. Bush resulted in dozens of corruption cases, with Border Patrol and other agents accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.\",\n          \"SHANKSVILLE, Pa.  \\u2014   Just another Thursday, and the morning mix includes   bikers from New Jersey, Amish visitors from Pennsylvania and a few children adjusting to a park not intended for play. They settle onto benches for the 11 o\\u2019clock retelling. A ranger in the green and gray of the United States National Park Service tucks his     lunch on a shelf and walks out to face his audience. A field of wildflowers undulates behind him the   clouds seem nearly within reach. He begins: \\u201cRemember how bad the weather was that morning?\\u201d Hesitant nods turn quickly to head shakes. No. On that particular September morning, you could see forever. This is just the ranger\\u2019s way of buckling you in. Helping some to remember what we already know. Helping others, especially those who were not yet born, to envision a beautiful, calamitous day now nearly 15 years in the past. His name is Robert Franz, he is 61, and his title is \\u201cinterpretive park ranger,\\u201d which means that his job is to tell the story of what happened in that   field behind him, again and again and again. This is the Flight 93 National Memorial, by far the most removed of the three   crash sites. A visit requires a   journey through the arresting Allegheny Mountains, up and down and up and down, past a Confederate flag here, a Trump sign there, to a   field set aside for reflection. \\u201cMayday! Mayday! Get out of here!\\u201d the ranger says, echoing the alarm that was heard by air traffic controllers. The words chill the   air, as children fidget and bees buzz about. He continues the story of United Airlines Flight 93, bound for San Francisco from Newark. How four hijackers redirect the jet southeast, most likely to crash into the nation\\u2019s capital. How many of the 40 crew members and passengers fought back. How this hurtling jetliner nearly flipped before crashing at 563 miles an hour into the soft,   earth, killing all. \\u201cThe crew and passengers put democracy in action,\\u201d Mr. Franz says. \\u201cThey take a vote\\u201d  \\u2014   to storm the cockpit and regain control of the plane. We connect to that day in our own way, and the storyteller in the   ranger\\u2019s hat is no different. He was born into the military, his father an Army lifer who served in World War II\\u2019s European theater, his mother a daughter of the French underground. They were married at the Cathedral of   in Paris, and went on a short honeymoon in an Army jeep. Their son Rob spent the better part of two decades flying Army Hueys and Black Hawks and training other soldiers how to fly helicopters. He left the service in early 2001, and was at home on Cape Cod, Mass. that Tuesday, watching the news. He thought of those he had trained, and felt guilt for not being among them for the deployments sure to come. Mr. Franz focused on a real estate career, volunteered with the local veterans\\u2019 committee and worked briefly as a police officer. Then, in late 2011, he spotted a listing on a government website for a seasonal job as an interpretive park ranger at the Flight 93 Memorial. He quickly applied, he recalls, sensing a chance to \\u201ccomplete the circle. \\u201d Soon he was driving about 600 miles west to Shanksville every April, and staying until October. He proved to be such a powerful storyteller, his presentation informed by his knowledge of aeronautics, that he was recently offered permanent employment, which he accepted. \\u201cHe told this story unlike anyone I had heard,\\u201d says Stephen Clark, the superintendent for the national parks in western Pennsylvania. \\u201cAnd, of course, being a veteran makes it all the more special. \\u201d Sometimes Mr. Franz stands at the memorial plaza, answering questions about the time of the crash and the location of the bathrooms. He commiserates as people recount their own connections to the day, and keeps his counsel as conspiracy theorists question whether such a crash even occurred. \\u201cIf somebody\\u2019s made up their mind, there\\u2019s nothing I can do,\\u201d he says. Sometimes he distributes Flight 93 Junior Ranger handbooks, explaining to young visitors what activities they need to complete before receiving a Junior Ranger badge. The   booklet is a thoughtful study in trying to find the right words: Early in the flight, their plane was hijacked by four men. To hijack a plane means to take control over it. These hijackers were angry at the United States of America   \\u2026     But there are words, and then there are words. When children ask about the recovery of bodies, Mr. Franz redirects, ever so slightly. Since there were only remains, no bodies, he explains that a spot out there, beyond the wildflowers, is now \\u201ca final resting place. \\u201d And sometimes, Mr. Franz is standing before another 11 o\\u2019clock crowd, as he is now, telling an American epic in less than a   all the while reminding himself not to get emotional again when he comes to a certain point. The more familiar narrative of Flight 93 focuses on those Mr. Franz calls the \\u201cbig guys\\u201d  \\u2014   Todd Beamer, for example, the young software salesman who helped to organize the passenger revolt and whose last recorded words of \\u201cLet\\u2019s roll!\\u201d became a national rallying cry. But the park ranger makes the gentle point that the revolt was \\u201ca group effort. \\u201d \\u201cLet me tell you about Sandy Bradshaw,\\u201d he says, recalling the    flight attendant who, in a furtive call to her husband, explained how she was boiling water to hurl at the hijackers. \\u201cLet me tell you about Honor Elizabeth Wainio,\\u201d he says, recalling the    business executive known as Lizz who, in a moment of supreme compassion, called to comfort her stepmother about what was to happen, and who was part of the revolt. She was 27. \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not looking good,\\u201d Mr. Franz says. \\u201cBut they weren\\u2019t going to give up. \\u201d The park ranger, the father of two adult daughters, looks down and takes a long, unscripted pause. As he struggles to regain his composure, the wildflower setting becomes   the bikers and the Amish now silent congregants in outdoor pews. Soon these people will wander off, some over to the   memorial wall, some up to the new visitors center, where Flight 93 shirts and mugs are sold, and an interactive display includes recordings from the fatal flight. Soon, a Korean War veteran will tell Mr. Franz that he thinks the federal government \\u201coverdid it\\u201d with this park, and a    boy in a tank top and a Penn State ball cap will ask for a Junior Ranger handbook so that he can learn about this place and earn his plastic badge. But right now, Mr. Franz is taking a brief private moment in public that seems to him like an hour. Sandy Bradshaw. Lizz Wainio. Democracy in action   \\u2026     His emotions in check, Mr. Franz acknowledges his awkward pause and returns seamlessly to his story. How the airplane flew right over Route 30, \\u201cthe road you came in on. \\u201d How this elevated ground is a place to reflect on the tragic loss of life, yes, but how it is also a place to honor the courage of the passengers and crew of Flight 93. And that, he says, \\u201cis a good story. \\u201d It\\u2019s 11:30. \\u201cThank you,\\u201d the ranger says. \\u201cHave a great day. \\u201d\",\n          \"LONDON  \\u2014   In November 1967, four years after her husband\\u2019s assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy traveled to the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia on a   trip with David Ormsby Gore, a friend of her husband and himself a recent widower. There was much speculation of a romantic attachment. A few months later, Mr. Ormsby Gore, a former British ambassador to Washington, proposed marriage. She turned him down. In a handwritten letter, filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty, she explained her decision to marry Aristotle Onassis instead. \\u201cIf ever I can find some healing and some comfort  \\u2014   it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cI can find that now  \\u2014   if the world will let us. \\u201d The letter was part of a set of papers found in locked   cases discovered only last month in Wales at the family home of Mr. Ormsby Gore, who died in 1985. They are being auctioned in London next month by his grandson to help restore the house. The letters point to the depth of feeling behind the public mask of one of the most celebrated women of her time. Among them is the letter to Mr. Ormsby Gore, also known as Lord Harlech, dated Nov. 13, 1968, a month after her marriage to Mr. Onassis and five months after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. In it, Mrs. Kennedy spoke of the love and bond she felt for Mr. Ormsby Gore, whose wife had died in a car crash in May 1967. \\u201cWe have known so much  shared  lost so much together  \\u2014   Even if it isn\\u2019t the way you wish now  \\u2014   I hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut. \\u201d Writing from Mr. Onassis\\u2019 yacht in Greece, on stationery with the ship\\u2019s crest, a clear if cold message, Mrs. Kennedy told Mr. Ormsby Gore: \\u201cYou are like my beloved beloved brother  \\u2014   and mentor  \\u2014   and the only original spirit I know  \\u2014   as you were to Jack. \\u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore had expressed incredulity at her choice of Mr. Onassis, and she tried to respond. \\u201cPlease know  \\u2014   you of all people must know it  \\u2014   that we can never really see into the heart of another,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cYou know me. And you must know that the man you write of in your letter is not a man that I could marry. \\u201d Mr. Onassis, she wrote, is \\u201clonely and wants to protect me from being lonely. And he is wise and kind. Only I can decide if he can, and I decided. \\u201cI know it comes as a surprise to so many people,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cBut they see things for me that I never wanted for myself. \\u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore was an old friend of John F. Kennedy, whose younger sister Kathleen, or Kick, married Mr. Ormsby Gore\\u2019s first cousin. After the election of the young president in 1960, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan sent Mr. Ormsby Gore to Washington as Britain\\u2019s ambassador. The two men, a year apart in age, were extremely close, and President Kennedy consulted with him on every key issue of foreign policy, especially during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and in discussions of Vietnam and nuclear disarmament. Robert Kennedy said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was \\u201calmost a part of the government,\\u201d adding that the president \\u201cwould rather have his judgment than that of anybody else. \\u201d Among the letters is one in which President Kennedy praised the ambassador: \\u201cI appreciate as you know, in all these critical matters your judgment  \\u2014   which I have found to be uniformly good and true. \\u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore inherited the noble title, Lord Harlech, when his father died in 1964. His grandson Jasset, who inherited the title a year ago, is the one selling the papers, along with other possessions, at Bonhams, London, in an auction scheduled for March 29. Some of the letters will be on view on March 2 in New York at the Bonhams showroom, at 580 Madison Avenue. In total, there are 18 handwritten letters and one typed letter from Mrs. Kennedy to Mr. Ormsby Gore, as well as other papers. Those include a pass admitting him to the White House on Nov. 23, 1963, one day after the assassination a jocular 1963 letter from Robert Kennedy, signed \\u201cBobby\\u201d and instructions for pallbearers for Robert Kennedy\\u2019s funeral. The papers also include a letter Mrs. Kennedy wrote to Mr. Ormsby Gore after the death of his wife, Sylvia, known as Sissie, which seemed to foreshadow his desire to marry her. \\u201cYour last letter was such a cri de coeur of loneliness  \\u2014   I would do anything to take that anguish from you,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cYou want to patch the wounds  match the loose pairs  \\u2014   but you can\\u2019t because your life won\\u2019t turn out that way. \\u201d One of the most moving documents is a draft letter Mr. Ormsby Gore wrote to Mrs. Kennedy after she turned down his proposal. \\u201cAll the pathetic plans I had brought with me for visits to Cyrenaica, holidays near one another and a whole variety of solutions to our marriage problem, including one for a secret marriage this summer  \\u2014   plans which I saw us eagerly discussing, calmly and with complete frankness as we did at the Cape and in Cambodia for the next wonderful ten days  \\u2014   all had become irrelevant trash to be thrown away within a few hours of my landing in New York,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cAs for your photograph I weep when I look at it. Why do such agonizing things have to happen? Where was the need for it?\\u201d The Kennedys and the Ormsby Gores socialized frequently, even stirring resentment among other diplomats and members of the administration. There were small dinners at the White House and shared vacations. One   \\u201cincoherent letter as written on Martini\\u201d from Mrs. Kennedy, in the spring of 1962, discusses their coming vacation at the America\\u2019s Cup races. Others mention her love of dance. Matthew Haley, the head of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams, said that \\u201cyou just don\\u2019t get this quantity of insight into Jackie\\u2019s personal life and that level of intimacy. \\u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore was her husband\\u2019s great friend, but \\u201cthe fact that they developed such an intimate friendship in such a short space of time is important,\\u201d he said, even if built on shared sadness. Contacted about the letters on Friday, a representative of the Kennedy family said that they had decided not to comment. Barbara Leaming, who has written biographies of President and Mrs. Kennedy, said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was \\u201cthe pivotal relationship Jack had in the presidency,\\u201d a man he trusted almost as much as Robert Kennedy. \\u201cJackie loved in Jack the man he wanted to be, and David was the man helping him, in her eyes, to be the man Jack wanted to be,\\u201d she said. The distress that followed Robert Kennedy\\u2019s assassination in June 1968 was one reason she turned to the security of Mr. Onassis, Ms. Leaming said. \\u201cIt was the second great trauma for her,\\u201d Ms. Leaming said. \\u201cShe was very clear it was not a marriage of love, as she said to Joe Alsop in a letter. She was seeking safety. \\u201d As for Mr. Ormsby Gore, \\u201cof course he fell in love with her  \\u2014   she understood him so well,\\u201d Ms. Leaming said. \\u201cBut I have no idea if it was consummated or not. \\u201d Mr. Ormsby Gore did marry again, in December 1969, to Pamela Colin, an American who bore more than a passing resemblance to Mrs. Onassis. He died in 1985, at 66, after a car crash. Mrs. Onassis attended his funeral.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Even before the winds and rain toppled nearly everything standing, cholera was already here. It came down from the mountains, washing into the lives of the thousands who once lived above the river. Now the only sign of life is in a makeshift clinic dealing with hundreds of suspected cholera cases, a small concrete building where just a few nurses contend with the swarms of patients arriving every hour. There is only one public official left. The mayor was struck by cholera and left on foot to seek treatment hours away. One deputy died of the disease last week. Another fled, like so many others, to escape the ruin visited on the town of Rendel by Hurricane Matthew and its aftermath. \\u201cNinety percent of our village is gone,\\u201d said Eric Valcourt, a priest in the Roman Catholic parish that runs the clinic and a school that now serves as a shelter for those too sick or poor to leave. \\u201cMany left by foot to escape the disease and devastation. The rest died from cholera or the hurricane. \\u201d A week has passed since the hurricane tore through this remote stretch of Haiti\\u2019s southern peninsula, leaving an apocalyptic landscape of treeless countryside, disarticulated homes and a land robbed of its natural riches. But for many, the torment has only started. Cholera, the disease at the heart of Haiti\\u2019s last disaster, is being spread again by this one. About 10, 000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been sickened since cholera first appeared in late 2010. Scientists say it was brought to Haiti by United Nations peacekeepers stationed at a base that leaked waste into a river. After years of deflecting blame, the United Nations this summer acknowledged \\u201cits own involvement\\u201d in the suffering Haiti has experienced from the disease. Now, cholera is stalking the areas gutted by the hurricane, a long peninsula of coastal towns and mountain villages where clean water was already hard to find, long before the storm. Here in the remote town of Rendel, a grueling   trek to the nearest paved road, the disease has spread to every crevice of this valley and the hills above. \\u201cWe are all at risk,\\u201d said the last official in Rendel, Pierre Cenel, the magistrate. A father raced down the hill to the clinic with his young daughter draped over his back, clutching her legs, his face fixed in fear. \\u201cShe must have cholera,\\u201d the magistrate said. \\u201cHe is running to save her life. \\u201d Cholera was creeping through the mountains even before the hurricane, claiming the lives of untold numbers as its pushed toward town. First came the sick, who trudged down to Rendel, desperate for medical care. Then, when the floods came, cholera was carried down by the water itself, which swept up fecal matter dumped on the hillsides, contaminating the river and other drinking supplies. Inexperience did the rest. Water unboiled or unchlorinated and poor hygiene meant the infections spread rapidly. The town of Rendel and its surroundings, which once sheltered 25, 000 people, are the epicenter of a potential disaster. Thousands have left on foot, forging a   river that bends so often that it requires nine crossings along the way. The things they carry are all they have left: split bags of clothes and small livestock. They carry disease, too, destined for towns connected to the rest of the country by road. One family braced for a river crossing, the youngest daughter in a purple dress with a pink sweater, clutching a live chicken in her arms. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what we will do, but we can\\u2019t live here,\\u201d said her father, Donald Augustin, 37, balancing a black suitcase on top of his head. \\u201cThe people are dying of cholera. \\u201d Those who remain bear witness to the slow release of misery. Heroic nurses care for patients splayed on the floor like rag dolls, some resting atop the improvised stretchers they arrived on. Patients vomit and defecate on the floor or into small yellow buckets, too sick to leave their stifling confines. The waste is emptied into an hole on the hill just behind the clinic, awaiting the next rainfall to overflow once again. The smell of bile and excrement stings the nostrils. Patients come and go to escape the stench and the oppressive heat, while relatives risk disease to tend to their loved ones. Many refuse to come to the clinic at all, fearful of being blamed for the outbreak. Sick people midway through their recoveries are shown the door to make way for new patients. A single lantern is the only light for the nurses to work by during grueling   shifts. A lowing child is rocked on her mother\\u2019s lap as an IV drip pumps fluids into her tiny arm. A young husband feeds his pregnant wife hot porridge, blowing over each spoonful as patients writhe beside and beneath them. A father kisses the ear of his    son to soften the taste of saline solution. \\u201cI spent the night here with her but the bed is too small for both of us so I slept outside and checked on her every hour,\\u201d said Jean Romit Cadet, 22, the young husband, handing the spoon to his wife and urging her to eat. \\u201cIf I get sick, I get sick. I\\u2019m responsible for her. \\u201d One morning this week, a rush of patients poured into the clinic, some carried on stretchers. A nurse tried to register each patient but lost track in the chaos, unable to take down everyone\\u2019s details. A young girl entered the clinic and told the head nurse she was suffering from diarrhea. \\u201cFor how many days?\\u201d the nurse asked. \\u201cThree,\\u201d the girl replied. \\u201cWhy are you only coming now?\\u201d the nurse demanded. \\u201cWe need to hook you up to an IV. \\u201d The girl refused. \\u201cI\\u2019m not vomiting,\\u201d she yelled over her shoulder as she left the clinic. The nurse turned to the crowd in the entrance of the clinic, a porch robbed of its roof by the storm. In its place hung a sagging blue tarp. \\u201cThis is the problem,\\u201d she told the crowd of patients, parents holding sick children and others laid out on the floor, their eyes lolling back into their heads. \\u201cShe doesn\\u2019t want to use the IV because she isn\\u2019t vomiting. But that doesn\\u2019t mean she doesn\\u2019t have cholera. \\u201d Another nurse approached and whispered that they were running out of needles for the IVs, which dangled like translucent vines from the rafters of the clinic. The nurse disappeared into a back room. A patient seated on a bench near the entrance erupted from his seat and vomited over the edge of the porch, onto ground where people walk to and from the back of the building. A mother and father tried to   their    son rehydration salts, sending the boy into fits. The child tried to bite the hand of an aide holding his arms. A nurse approached and asked the family if they had symptoms. The mother, Osila Cominan, said it was her third day with diarrhea, but quickly added that she was not vomiting and did not need treatment. \\u201cYou should be on an IV, too,\\u201d the nurse said, before rushing to another patient vomiting on the floor. In the town, citizens had set up a roadside cleaning station, a simple affair with a tank of chlorinated water that was sprayed onto the shoes and hands of those fleeing. With all the departures, the fear of carrying cholera to bigger cities was a real one. The town itself was hollowed out. Those still here stood on what remained of front porches, mired in a state of shock, hoping the people would return. The stasis was interrupted every so often by another patient heading to the clinic, staggering down the rocky paths or carried aloft by family. A few concrete homes provide the only reminder of the town that was. Lesser houses have been stacked into piles along with the trees and branches scattered by the storm. \\u201cWhen you look around you, it\\u2019s like the end of the world,\\u201d said Joseph Kenso, 33. \\u201cLook around you. The disaster speaks for itself. \\u201d One of the only buildings left is the clinic, a   structure that formerly served as a center for prenatal care. The original cholera care center was destroyed in the hurricane. It had opened only a week before the storm, to treat people streaming in from the outbreak in the mountains above. In the center of town, wearing just one   Mr. Cenel, the magistrate, smiled ruefully at the town\\u2019s misfortune and his own, estimating that hundreds have died between the hurricane and the disease. But his math is like that of many: a reflection of the emotional toll, not an exact one. \\u201cAfter a hurricane, if you don\\u2019t see someone for a few days, they are usually dead,\\u201d he said. Sixty percent of the town has now fled, he said. \\u201cNo! I disagree,\\u201d said a man standing in the magistrate\\u2019s front yard. \\u201cIt\\u2019s at least 85 percent of the population gone. \\u201d Another man standing nearby said the people would return once they could rid the area of cholera. He was sure of it. \\u201cThey might,\\u201d said the magistrate, whose mother and father are among those who left. \\u201cThey might. \\u201d But how do you combat cholera in a place where people get their water from the river or surrounding springs, where disinfectant is a luxury? One woman leaving the clinic with soiled sheets was stopped by a nurse, who asked her to drop them in a pile of clothing to be burned that night. The woman hesitated, throwing her hand over her eyes as she addressed the nurse. \\u201cI can\\u2019t,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThis is all I have left. \\u201d The toll from cholera is unknowable. Most of the departed never make it to the clinic and get buried without any record. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t know how many have died in the surrounding community,\\u201d said another nurse, Marie Marguerite Bernadin, 42. \\u201cBut we know most of the deaths occur outside of here. \\u201d If the cases are caught early enough, the nurses explained, treatment is as simple as rehydration. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t come on time because for some of them it\\u2019s an embarrassment and they tried to hide the sick,\\u201d explained Alicia Hyppolite, 32, a nurse in the clinic. \\u201cAnd people don\\u2019t listen when you tell them things. \\u201d About an hour and a half north is the village of Delibarain, a hamlet near the mountain river that feeds the springs of Rendel. Before the hurricane, residents and officials said there were several deaths from cholera, or what they believed to be cholera, since there were no labs on hand to confirm the disease. The first ones that residents and local leaders can remember were the members of the Vital family, five of whom died from the disease. The dead were buried in graves without wrapping them in plastic, wearing gloves or taking the precautionary measures applied to   bodies. Soon, even more people were infected. The rainy season spread the disease farther. \\u201cThey just placed them in the earth,\\u201d said Thomas Cyril, 47, who lives in the village and knew the family. Prostrate on the floor were his brother, Faniel Cyril, and his cousin, Alicia Delcy, both of whom were showing symptoms of cholera. Faniel, barely conscious, reached out to grab the hand of Mrs. Delcy from time to time. Frightened of what was happening in their village, the pair had come down the mountain on Sunday to seek treatment. It was bad in Rendel, he granted, but up the mountain it was worse. \\u201cNow the people are really dying,\\u201d Mr. Cyril said.\",\n          \"While Donald Rakes In Donations From Poor Supporters, His Wealthy Kids Give ZILCH (VIDEO) By Ellen Brodsky on October 30, 2016 Subscribe \\nIf money talks, the Trump kids\\u2019 lack of donations to their father\\u2019s presidential campaign speaks volumes. Despite the fact that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\\u2019s children are frequent surrogates for their father, they have not dug into their wallets for his White House run. \\nAccording to The Daily Beast , the sum total of donations from Trump\\u2019s four adult children is $376.20. That amount came from Eric Trump and was described as an in-kind donation for meals. But he was reimbursed the same amount that same day. \\nThe Trump kids have donated large sums for political causes in the past. According to a 2015 report by OpenSecrets.org : Daughter Ivanka Trump has donated over $130,000 to Republicans and Democrats; Son Donald Trump, Jr. has donated more than $80,000 to candidates and committees from both sides of the aisle; Son Eric Trump has given approximately $51,000, mostly to Republicans, and Trump\\u2019s youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump, is not listed in the report. \\nIt\\u2019s not just Trump\\u2019s family that has refrained from donating to his campaign. Also missing from the Trump-donor rolls, according to The Daily Beast , are such prominent surrogates as Rudy Giuliani, Ben Carson, and Newt Gingrich. \\nMeanwhile, The Daily Beast also notes, Trump is raking in lots of dough from small contributors: \\u201cWhen the Trump campaign began soliciting online donations in June , the candidate asked for a paltry $10 from each contributor\\u2014an appeal his millionaire kids didn\\u2019t respond to. The request resulted in a quick $3 million haul from his supporters though. And by September, Trump had paid his own businesses around $8.2 million , comprised of rent, food, and facilities and payroll for corporate staffers. He even used tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations to buy copies of his own book .\\u201d \\nMaybe Trump\\u2019s inner circle hasn\\u2019t donated because they know where the money\\u2019s really going. \\nThe Young Turks\\u2019 Cenk Uygur explains further how Trump uses campaign donations to line his own pockets: \\nWatch this interview with the entire Trump clan : \\n\\nFeatured Image: Screenshot Via YouTube Video.

Five of the wooden behemoths, weighing more than 200 pounds each and sitting atop a quartet of gurney wheels, were made in the late 1970s at the request of Edwin H. Land, the company\\u2019s founder, to demonstrate the quality of his   film. But the cameras found their true home in the art world, taken up by painters like Chuck Close and Robert Rauschenberg and photographers like William Wegman, David Levinthal and Mary Ellen Mark to make instant images that had the size and presence of sculpture. In 2008, Polaroid, in bankruptcy, stopped producing instant film. Mr. Reuter, who had worked at the company for decades, swooped in with the help of an investor, buying one of the original cameras and hundreds of cases of the remaining film. The dream was to make enough money to be able to recreate the manufacturing process for the film and its unwieldy chemicals and to make more of the big cameras. But in an interview last week, Mr. Reuter said he had finally decided to bow to the inevitable: There will never be a large enough demand for the cameras and he can no longer maintain his quixotic effort to keep them alive. The company he runs, the 20x24 Studio, based in central Massachusetts, plans to close by the end of next year, by which time he hopes that much of the remaining film stock will be used up. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been doing this for 40 years now, and I understand the importance of the history maybe better than anyone else,\\u201d said Mr. Reuter, who is also a photographer and filmmaker. \\u201cBut there is a time when things have to come to an end. These are not materials that were designed to last indefinitely, and the investment to keep making them would be huge, multimillions. \\u201d News of the wind down has been spreading for several months through the art world, where it has been met more often with disbelief than disappointment. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t given up,\\u201d said Mr. Close, one of the first artists to begin using the camera in the late 1970s to make photographs as both the basis for painted portraits and as works themselves. \\u201cHere\\u2019s yet another medium that will be lost to history, and it just shouldn\\u2019t be allowed to happen. If it does, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m going to do, to tell you the truth. It\\u2019s so integrated into everything I do. I can always imagine what making a painting from one of those pictures will look like. \\u201d Like other artists he knows who have used the camera, he said, its attraction is not just in its size and endearingly oddball personality, like a creature from an obsessive hobbyist\\u2019s garage. The immediacy of making the picture, Mr. Close said, changes the relationship between the subject and the artist, who together witness the image come into being after the photograph is pulled from the camera and the chemicals perform their function. \\u201cYou both work together to get something that you want out of it. Your subject knows what you\\u2019re trying to do. \\u201d (He described a 2012 session with President Obama in a hotel room so tiny that the camera and Mr. Close\\u2019s wheelchair  \\u2014   a   collapse more than two decades ago left him partially paralyzed  \\u2014   crowded out the Secret Service.) The filmmaker Errol Morris, who is making a documentary about the photographer Elsa Dorfman  \\u2014   besides Mr. Reuter, perhaps the camera\\u2019s most devoted partisan  \\u2014   said that the camera had become a character in its own right in his film. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an objet d\\u2019art, with these wheels like bicycle wheels, this huge box,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhen Elsa pulls the film down from the camera and cuts across it and then the photo is brought over to a table and the cover is peeled back and this image slowly appears, there\\u2019s something quite magical about it. \\u201d Mr. Reuter said maintaining that magic has exhausted him and the two people who work with him, Nafis Azad and Ted McLelland. Together, they help operate the cameras, store the photographic paper and assemble the chemical pods, a highly complicated process accomplished with a    machine. With no real publicity operation, the initial financial challenges of the Great Recession and prices he probably set too high, Mr. Reuter said, \\u201cthe demand for the cameras really just never materialized at the levels that it did during the Polaroid years I think a lot of people had no idea the process was still in existence. \\u201d (The camera costs $1, 750 a day to rent and each exposure costs $125, down from $200 at the company\\u2019s beginning.) Though Mr. Close and a handful of other artists, like Peter Tunney and Joyce Tenneson, still use the camera, the death of Ms. Mark last year meant that a consistent financial mainstay  \\u2014   and a widely respected ambassador for the camera  \\u2014   was gone. \\u201cMy goal is for people to use the rest of the material we have before all of it is really past its prime,\\u201d Mr. Reuter said. \\u201cIt would be a shame to end that way. \\u201d As for the cameras themselves, he said with resignation, \\u201cI hope that they go to some place like the Smithsonian or the George Eastman collection in Rochester. \\u201d Mr. Morris, known for his own love of rapidly rarefying film stocks like 35 millimeter and Super 8, said he continued to believe that the cameras would not end up as museum pieces. \\u201cMaybe there won\\u2019t be many  \\u2014   and maybe there will be a time when the process goes out of existence for a while  \\u2014   but I think there will be people who won\\u2019t let it go away forever. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He compared black Republicans to Jews helping Nazis during the Holocaust. Benjamin Barber also said that blacks are \\u201cseriously f***ed in the head.\\u201d \\nJames O\\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas have been relentless in exposing Democrats and the left this election cycle. They\\u2019ve done terrific work, much to the chagrin of Barber. Benjamin and Leah Barber were caught on undercover video at a fundraiser for Ross. They are also major donors to Hillary Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign. Figures. \\nFirst up in the video is Ross comparing voter ID laws to racist Jim Crow laws in the South. Then the conversation with the Barbers began. And it was a doozy. \\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t make sense,\\u201d Leah Barber said about African Americans who support Republicans. \\u201cYou\\u2019re voting against your self-interest. In the name of change, what is the change that they want to see?\\u201d \\nFrom PJ Media : \\nIn a new video released today by Project Veritas Action, a top Democratic donor is caught on camera horribly maligning Republican blacks at a fundraiser for North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate Deborah Ross. In the video, Benjamin Barber, a prominent Ross and Clinton donor, compares blacks who vote Republican to Nazis at the fundraiser for Ross on the Upper West Side of New York City on September 19, 2016. \\n\\u201cHave you heard of the Sonderkommandos? Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So blacks who are helping the other side are seriously fucked in the head,\\u201d Barber said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re only helping the enemy who will destroy them. Maybe they think \\u2018if I help them we\\u2019ll get along okay; somehow I\\u2019ll save my race by working with the murderers.\\u2019\\u201d \\nThe irony here is rich considering the sordid history of George Soros , another prominent big Democrat donor who literally was a Jewish Nazi collaborator as a teenager during World War II in his native Budapest, Hungary. \\nAn analogy of the Sonderkommandos\\u2026 work units in Nazi death camps? This guy just trashed African Americans and Jews. What an asshat. The death camps were usually composed of Jewish males, forced to dispose of bodies from the gas chambers. They did not assist with the killings themselves. Assertions otherwise are obscene. \\nProject Veritas showed the video to some religious leaders and others in the black community who were shocked by the contents of the video. \\n\\u201cI think that Deborah Ross has shown her true colors. If this is not a, if that\\u2026 what you just showed me is not racism and condescending and basically calling blacks stupid and ignorant and saying that we are voting against our own self-interest if we support any Republican. I am appalled. I am incensed. Deborah Ross should be called to task for something like that,\\u201d said Bishop Wooden, a black voter in North Carolina. \\nNo one should be shocked by this\\u2026 the undercurrent of racism and Antisemitism has always been out there for the Democrats. You just got to see some honesty for a change instead of the usual pandering. Disgusting and revealing. 0\",\n          \"  David Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

What Keeps the F-35 Alive By David Swanson on October 31, 2016 Petition to Stop F-35 Going Global \\nby David Swanson \\nImagine if a local business in your town invented a brand new tool that was intended to have an almost magical effect thousands of miles away. However, where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children. Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones, lower reading skills, poorer memories, impaired auditory and speech perception, and impaired academic performance. \\nMost of us would find this situation at least a little concerning, unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people. Then it\\u2019d be just fine. \\nNow, imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldn\\u2019t safely live near it. Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool. Again, I think, we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission. \\nImagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes, emitting highly toxic chemicals, particles, and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around. Normally, that\\u2019d be a problem. But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people, we\\u2019ll work with its flaws, won\\u2019t we? \\nNow, what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least $1,400,000,000,000 over 50 years? And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world? What if the $1.4 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education, healthcare, housing, environmental protection, or humanitarian aid? Wouldn\\u2019t that be a worry in some cases, I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasn\\u2019t at stake? \\nWhat if this product, even when working perfectly, was a leading destroyer of the earth\\u2019s natural environment? \\nWhat if this high-tech toy wasn\\u2019t even designed to do what was expected of it and wasn\\u2019t even able to do what it was designed for? \\nAmazingly, even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction. Then, all is forgiven. \\nThe tool I\\u2019m describing is called the F-35. At RootsAction.org you can find a new petition launched by locally-minded people acting globally in places where the F-35 is intended to be based. Also at that link you\\u2019ll find explanations of how the tool I\\u2019ve been decribing is the F-35. \\nThe petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington, Vermont, and Fairbanks, Alaska, where the F-35 is to be based. This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition, Save Our Skies Vermont, Western Maine Matters, Alaska Peace Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club, North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace, World Beyond War, RootsAction.org, Code Pink, and Ben Cohen. \\nThe petition reads: \\nThe F-35 is a weapon of offensive war, serving no defensive purpose. It is planned to cost the U.S. $1.4 trillion over 50 years. Because starvation on earth could be ended for $30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for $11 billion per year, it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill. Military spending, contrary to popular misconception, also hurts the U.S. economy ( see here ) and other economies. The F-35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases. It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use. It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes. Its emissions are a major environmental polluter. \\nWars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them. Nonviolent tools of law, diplomacy, aid, crisis prevention, and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars. Therefore, we, the undersigned, call for the immediate cancellation of the F-35 program as a whole, and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas. We oppose replacing the F-35 with any other weapon or basing the F-35 in any other locations. We further demand redirection of the money for the F-35 back into taxpayers\\u2019 pockets, and into environmental and human needs in the U.S., other F-35 customer nations, and around the world, including to fight climate change, pay off student debt, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and improve education, healthcare, and housing. \\nAdd your name . \\nDavid Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn\\u2019t get the memo\\u2026Trump\\u2019s tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn\\u2019t too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, \\u201cThere will never be a President Trump\\u201d. \\nPerhaps Amal should\\u2019ve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns\\u2026 \\nAmal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump\\u2019s proposals would be \\u2018violations of international law.\\u2019 \\nSpeaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America\\u2019s reputation under the real estate mogul\\u2019s plans. \\nShe noted that Trump\\u2019s comments during his campaign, \\u2018that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed \\u2014 all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.\\u2019 \\nThe 38-year-old wife said America\\u2019s reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. \\n\\u2018I think there\\u2019s some concern from abroad as to, \\u201cAre these things actually going to happen?\\u201d, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,\\u2019 according to the Hollywood Reporter. \\nPerhaps its time to put our nation\\u2019s security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us\\u2026 \\nBoth Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. \\nEarlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. \\nWatch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: \\n\\u2018When you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, \\u2018They only want jihad. They don\\u2019t believe in our way of life. They don\\u2019t respect our system,\\u201d Clooney said.

[\\u201cThere are only two rules in the Latino family,\\u201d Lopez said Saturday night during a live show in Phoenix. \\u201cDon\\u2019t marry somebody black and don\\u2019t park in front of our house. \\u201d  Video posted by TMZ shows a woman in the audience giving Lopez the middle finger and appearing to be offended by the comic\\u2019s pun. Lopez apparently saw the woman protesting his set and proceeded to offer her some pointed advice: \\u201cSit your f*ckin\\u2019 ass down! Sit your f*ckin\\u2019 ass down! I\\u2019m talking, b*tch. You paid to see a show. So sit your f*cking ass down!\\u201d [Warning: Explicit Language] But the former ABC star\\u2019s harsh demands appeared to enrage the woman even more. Determined to take back control of his show, he doubled down: \\u201cYou can\\u2019t take a joke, you\\u2019re in the wrong motherf*cking place,\\u201d he said as the crowd cheered him on. \\u201cSit your f*cking ass down or get the f*ck out of here,\\u201d Lopez warned. Toward the end of the clip, Lopez apparently had the woman removed from the building. \\u201cI tell you what, I\\u2019ll make the choice for you. Get the f*ck out of here,\\u201d he said as the woman was escorted from her table. \\u201cFour seats just opened up front. \\u201d The    comedian appeared to address the controversy on his Twitter account Tuesday morning. \\u201cYou have 2 choices  have a good day or get the f*ck out,\\u201d he tweeted.

[The film, starring the late John Hurt, will be screened on April 4, the date in the book in which Smith begins his rebellion against Big Brother, the   eye of the fascist regime.  The 1949 novel follows the struggles of Winston Smith, a man living in a totalitarian police state, and has become culturally iconic as a symbol of fascist regimes. Leading independent cinemas including the Alamo Drafthouse, IFC Center, and Film Society of Lincoln Center have all signed up to host screenings, according to the Independent. Although the theater protests form part of a wider opposition to Donald Trump\\u2019s agenda, the group behind the effort says its goal is to push back against the Trump administration\\u2019s reported plans to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. \\u201cThe endeavor encourages theaters to take a stand for our most basic values: freedom of speech, respect for our fellow human beings, and the simple truth that there are no such things as \\u2018alternative facts\\u2019. By doing what they do best  \\u2014   showing a movie  \\u2014   the goal is that cinemas can initiate a   community conversation at a time when the existence of facts and basic human rights are under attack,\\u201d reads a statement from the project\\u2019s website. \\u201cThrough nationwide participation and strength in numbers, these screenings are intended to galvanize people at the crossroads of cinema and community, and bring us together to foster communication and resistance against current efforts to undermine the most basic tenets of our society,\\u201d it continues. Since Trump\\u2019s inauguration, Amazon revealed that sales of the book 1984 have risen significantly.

[The film, starring the late John Hurt, will be screened on April 4, the date in the book in which Smith begins his rebellion against Big Brother, the   eye of the fascist regime.  The 1949 novel follows the struggles of Winston Smith, a man living in a totalitarian police state, and has become culturally iconic as a symbol of fascist regimes. Leading independent cinemas including the Alamo Drafthouse, IFC Center, and Film Society of Lincoln Center have all signed up to host screenings, according to the Independent. Although the theater protests form part of a wider opposition to Donald Trump\\u2019s agenda, the group behind the effort says its goal is to push back against the Trump administration\\u2019s reported plans to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. \\u201cThe endeavor encourages theaters to take a stand for our most basic values: freedom of speech, respect for our fellow human beings, and the simple truth that there are no such things as \\u2018alternative facts\\u2019. By doing what they do best  \\u2014   showing a movie  \\u2014   the goal is that cinemas can initiate a   community conversation at a time when the existence of facts and basic human rights are under attack,\\u201d reads a statement from the project\\u2019s website. \\u201cThrough nationwide participation and strength in numbers, these screenings are intended to galvanize people at the crossroads of cinema and community, and bring us together to foster communication and resistance against current efforts to undermine the most basic tenets of our society,\\u201d it continues. Since Trump\\u2019s inauguration, Amazon revealed that sales of the book 1984 have risen significantly.
